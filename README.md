#Arcade Game
This is one of my assignments for the Front-and-End NanoDegree at Udacity.

##About the Game
It is a small game to be played on the webpage. The goal of the game is to let the little boy/girl safely walk to the river.

###Score
If caught by an enemy, he/she will be moved to the starting point with your score decreases 10 (original is 100).
If a treasure is eaten, your score will increase 20.

###Pause/Refresh
There are three buttons on the left-top corner, which you might need when you wanna temporarily stop the game to grab a drink, or start the game from the very beginning.

###Choose a Figure
You can change the figure by the selector on the right-top corner! Some cute figures are available! Have a look!
